# T.O.N.G 
- tong is a simple voice assistant which contains of a few basic features.
- I made this project for fun. I named it tong cuz my mom wanted me to do it :P

# Customizing
> you can go to `./ai/index.html` and `./ai/tong.js` and change tong to whatever name you want <br>
> you can go to `./ai/tong.js` and go to line 213 and change to any youtube playlist you like (PS: Im trying to get it working using a json file)

# Adding commands
> `js
> else if(message.includes('your_command')) {
>    // what ever features you want to add
>    const finalText = 'what ever you want',
>    speak.text = finalText
>}`

#
> change your_command to your command name, 'what ever you want' to what your assistant will respond
